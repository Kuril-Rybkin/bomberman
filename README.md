# bomberman

This was a semestral project for the Programing and Algorithmics 2 subject. The goal was to develop an interactive console game similar to the game "bomberman".

The game is supposed to run on linux, and features:
- Singleplayer (PvE) gamemode
  - AI behaviour was not part of the task, so the bot behaviour is random.
- Local multiplayer (1 v 1)
- Storing highscores to file
- Storing maps/levels to file
- Bonuses which the player can pick up
